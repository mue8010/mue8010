Graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology working as an Auditor & Software Engineer @ Goldman Sachs

I create internal tools, audit against software and risk within the firm. I have created content in SQL, Python, R. 
I'm confident reading and writing code and have worked with reading and interpretation of Java, Shell Scripting, and other languages such as those listed above.

When in school, I built my own website and have made slight modifications to it since. You can view that here: https://sites.google.com/g.rit.edu/mickey/
