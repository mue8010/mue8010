### Hi there ðŸ‘‹, I am Mickey Evans
[![Twitter Follow](https://img.shields.io/twitter/follow/MickeyEvans_?style=social)](https://twitter.com/MickeyEvans_)

Graduate from Rochester Institute of Technology working as a Data Analyst @ Goldman Sachs. 
I have created scripts in SQL to query data, Python to build functions for automation of certain tasks, have used R to perform analytics & make visualizations. 

In school, I built my own website and have made slight modifications to it since. You can view that here: [My Website](https://sites.google.com/g.rit.edu/mickey/), which was made through Google Sites and is considered a fairly low code solution.
